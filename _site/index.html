              Welcome to the website of the Chi Zeta chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi Professional Business Fraternity.

              We are proud to be part of the history of Alpha Kappa Psi, both here at NJIT and around the world.
              Alpha Kappa Psi is a co-ed professional fraternity dedicated to developing principled business leaders.
              We emphasize five core values: brotherhood, knowledge, integrity, service, and unity.
              These values make up everything that we do as an organization and individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Making the decision to become involved in Alpha Kappa Psi has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my college career thus far.
              As an active founding member, I learned the inner workings of establishing an organization from the ground up.
              This fraternity has shown me what it is like to be a part of something so much bigger than myself, while also helping me realize how much I can contribute as an individual.
              Not only have I made lifelong friendships and indelible memories, but I am confident that I am better prepared for life after college.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am incredibly proud of our chapter for accomplishing so many milestones this past year.
              Moreover, I am honored to be the president of an organization of such inspiring, loyal, and dedicated individuals.
              I am grateful to call these people my Brothers.
            </p>
            <p>
              On behalf of this brotherhood here at Chi Zeta, I invite you to look through our site and learn about all the benefits our organization has to offer.
              Please do not hesitate to reach out to us, and we hope you will continue to learn more and join us at a future rush event.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sincerely,
              </br>

            <p>
              The Chi Zeta Chapter at the New Jersey Institute of Technology was established in April 2017 by a large group of passionate and dedicated student leaders.
              The underlying purpose of the development of this Professional Business Fraternity was to get the students involved in impacting change at NJIT.
              Since its inception, this fraternity has accepted Brothers that are leaders in all sorts of campus activities including Student Government, Social Fraternities, New Student Orientations, Honors Student Council, Residence Life, and more.
              These distinguished men and women come from every school and every major with the common goal of developing their skills in leadership and business.
              The beauty of Chi Zeta is in the fact that our Brothers are a diverse group of individuals from all walks of life who have found unity in their passion to become more impactful individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our chapter takes it upon itself to identify areas within the campus and local community in which we can make a difference.
              We collaborate with corporations to host activities including case competitions, networking events, corporate tours, and more.
              We work with organizations on campus to create engaging and beneficial events for the entire student body.
              Through these activities, our Brothers have the opportunity to meet with industry leaders in nearly every field, create relationships that last a lifetime, and make a change that they can be proud of.
              At the end of the day, when you become a Brother of Alpha Kappa Psi, you become a part of much more than just a brotherhood.
              You engage.
              You inspire.
              You take charge of your future and change the world, one step at a time.
